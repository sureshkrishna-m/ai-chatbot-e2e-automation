Required Documents for UAE Driver’s License Renewal

To renew your driver’s license in the UAE, you typically need to prepare the following documents and fulfill certain requirements:

Valid Emirates ID

This serves as your primary identification and is required for all residents.

Current UAE Driving License

The original license that you wish to renew must be presented.

Recent Passport-Size Photograph

The photo should have a white background and meet UAE standards (no headgear unless for religious reasons).

Eye Test Result

You must undergo an eye test at an RTA-approved center. The results are usually updated directly in the RTA system.

Copy of Residency Visa

For expatriates, a copy of your valid residency visa may be required.

No Objection Certificate (NOC)

In some cases, especially if your employment or sponsorship status has changed, a NOC from your employer or sponsor might be requested.

Payment of Outstanding Fines

Any traffic fines must be settled before renewal can proceed.
Additional Notes
The process can be completed online via the RTA website, Dubai Drive App, or in person at RTA service centers.
Special categories (diplomats, people of determination, Emirati nationals) may have additional requirements.
After submission, you may receive a temporary license until the new one is ready.

 "reasoning": "The chatbot's response is largely factually correct and maintains an appropriate public service tone. It identifies core required documents such as Emirates ID, eye test results, and the need to clear outstanding fines. It also correctly mentions renewal channels (online/app/service centers) and provisions for special categories and temporary licenses. However, its completeness is compromised by the omission of critical information regarding specific renewal fees and the permissible renewal window (up to 6 months before expiry) detailed in the Expected Response. Additionally, it includes documents like 'Current UAE Driving License', 'Recent Passport-Size Photograph', 'Copy of Residency Visa', and 'No Objection Certificate' which, while potentially applicable in specific or older scenarios, are often not standard requirements for a general, streamlined driver's license renewal in the UAE today, especially online. This could potentially cause confusion or unnecessary effort for the user. No fabricated facts or incoherence were detected.",

The system will display the renewal fee (typically AED 300 for those over 21, AED 100 for under 21, plus AED 20 Knowledge and Innovation fee).
Pay the fee online using a credit or debit card.
Receive a digital temporary license (if applicable) and instructions for collecting your renewed license.
3. Additional Payment Options
